Classification of Images using CNN

We trained our CNN model(alexnet) on original samples images and tested its accuracy on GAN generated images.
Two types of GAN generated output images were classified:
1) Images generated with just border outline label.
2) Images generated with border and veins label. 

Classification Accuracy for just the border outline was observed to be better

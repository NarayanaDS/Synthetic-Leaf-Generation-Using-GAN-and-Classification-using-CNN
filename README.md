GAN for Synthetic Leaves Generation and Classification with CNN

Two GAN networks for Synthetic Leaf Generation and Classification of those synthetic Generated Leaves using CNN.

Step 1. Vein detection     (Data Pre-processing)
Step 2. GAN                (GAN reconstruction using pre-processed image)
Step 3. CNN                (Classification using Alexnet)
